       "'I don\\'t know if I would buy thus brand again seems like they don\\'t last as long as Duracell These do not last long at all very cheap batteries no happy These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That\\'s a 1/4 capacity. First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Junk batteries. These batteries don\\'t last even in a simple digital clock. 2 weeks at best. Date on the back of these were 1992. Yeah, 1992. Inedible. Battery storage life only lasted 8 months (stored indoors). During my first recharging they were leaking and wrapping was coming off. A waste of money These don\\'t last long at all. Lasted about a week in my electric toothbrush. Energizer and Duracell brand lasted a month. Tried with 4 different Amazon batteries, same results. Very dissatisfied All the batteries came dead so I did a return and got new ones. Second order was the same as the first.Update: still have yet to receive refund from second order after several weeks!!! all dead My 37 days old Amazon fire stick quit working, the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasn\\'t getting any juice. Tried 3 different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldn\\'t work-and yes, I put them in the right way. Contacted Amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past 30 days purchased and couldn\\'t return, but before sending back for warranty service and being without TV for who knows how long and just to make sure, I bought some energizer batteries. Wouldn\\'t you know it, the remote fired right back up. Can\\'t trust these batteries. I use hundreds of AAAs annually, and despite the graphics in ad, these are about the poorest performing, with least longevity, of any I have bought. Still have another 100 of these, but will likely go thru those quickly. These are budget friendly but don\\'t last! I bought for my battery operated candles that typically use batteries for 6-8 weeks. Twice these batteries barely lasted 1 week. It was so disappointing. Amazon produce are usually so good, but I would not recommend these. Approximately half of the batteries I\\'ve tried so far are dead. Low expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again. Not good I\\'ve been using these on my roku remote and the lifespan is terrible. About two weeks, when Duracell\\'s have been 1-2 months Awful poor performance. My mouse ran for several weeks to several months from Duracells but have never gotten more that several days from these. Will not buy again. These batteries do not hold charge well. By the time I need to use it few weeks none of them work BAD BATCH NOT LASTING!Have been using these for the Roku Remote, and they are dying after just a few days of use.Have been happy with Amazon battery purchases in the past.Not sure if the quality is overall lower than it once was, or if this was just a bad batch. Theses did not work. Wanted to make sure I had batteries for the item I was purchasing but they did not work. I had to dig some out of my junk drawer. Wrong item. Many of the batteries are no good. Wish I didn\\'t buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand. Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won\\'t make this mistake again. These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years. This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days. I have two Macs, each with their own wireless mac keyboards. I used these batteries in both keyboards and each worked great for several days. My desk keyboard failed to connect last week so I attempted to replace the batteries, but they had expanded inside the keyboard and will not come out. I assumed it was a chance happening. But now my wireless keyboard at my downstairs computer just failed. The batteries have expanded inside that keyboard as well and will not come out. Amazon refunded us for the batteries but now we need to replace the two keyboards the batteries ruined. Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again Beware these batteries - I just packed them up for returning hated to have to do so but they lasted only 5 hours in tiny flashlights for my grand kids !!! Big disappointment too - won\\'t buy this brand batteries again...nor do I recommend them to anyone out there ! Just purchased in October and replaced the batteries in my camping lantern this past week using these. The batteries leaked inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether. I attempted to clean the contacts and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaked that the plastic and internals have a permanent coat of oxidation on it. Had to buy a new lantern. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point. I was excited to see that Amazon was allowing its name to be used on batteries as I feel that Amazon is concerned about its image. Bought these batteries and placed four of them into my camera. Took 2 RAW photos and the batteries are now dead. What a disappointment. 2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up. None of first eight batteries I opened worked. Tested other batteries to confirm was a battery problem. Confirmed!!!Wow. I change the batteries at least once a month. These things eat batteries like crazy and are hardly used. Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat. Leaked all over our lantern battery case. I purchased these batteries for an emergency since they had a long shelf life. I put 4 batteries into each of my lanterns and 2 each into my flashlights. I have multiple battery leaks between the lanterns and flashlights. I ended up spending over an hour cleaning up the battery cases and flashlights. I\\'ve purchased the AAA pack as well and don\\'t seem to have the same problem. This item arrived with no battery pack. There is no way to power the toy without it because you can\\'t just use regular batteries. Be Careful with this one - I put 4 of these into my TV remote and almost immediately had one pop. I could hear a sizzling sound within the remote and I immediately took out the battery carrier (I inserted them in proper polarity). One of the batteries was actually fizzling at the female end where it had split and was leaking. Unreal.... I\\'ve never had a battery do this before. I will NOT be ordering these ever again. Had these in my wii for 2 weeks and the batteries leaked all over. I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death! Sorry to say these batteries leaked in a lighted mirror and ruined it. C\\'mon, Amazon! bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture. Bought these for my sisters day care. She said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these I love Amazon. I am a prime member. Have had an amazon credit card for 16 years. Think their service and pricing is second to none.But.... these batteries are garbage. Gar-bage.They really don\\'t work or at the very least don\\'t work most of the time. Even when they do appear to work they only last like 1/4 of the time a normal AA would. Maybe you can justify the pricing for certain situations.Should you use them for led string lights and hope they last a couple months Yep.Portable defribrilator No.RC car Sure.Camera for younger sister\\'s wedding in the Greek Isles Nope.Vibrating nose hair trimmer Ok.Computer battery for your 17 hour flight to Siberia Nyet.Get my drift... sure try them out, and keep trying them, like I have, but don\\'t put any faith in them. These are the WORST batteries I have ever encountered anywhere in my 46-year life! I am appalled that Amazon put their name on them I guarantee that if these had been my first Amazon purchase, I would never have done business here again. If they had not been wrapped in packs of 4 batteries in cellophane, I would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to Amazon.None of the batteries was anywhere close to full power - they couldn\\'t provide adequate power to anything I tried them in for any battery-powered item to work properly. Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. None of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Every item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I\\'m sure I would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them. I am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any battery-powered device!!! Not good. Don\\'t last a week. These are wretched batteries. They typically last only two weeks in a TV remote control device, they can\\'t power a computer\\'s mouse beyond a week, and I have serious doubts about their shelf life. Packaging is nice, though, sort of like The Washington Post. Bad investment. Some of the batteries did not even work - no juice in them. Really surprised by the poor quality, Amazon Basics. Terrible batteries!! They exploded all over my face. Received them on a Monday and that Sunday was having problems with my remote so I opened it up and was sprayed in the face with acid. Luckily it missed my eye. I have bought cheap batteries before and never had anything like this happen before!! From experience, the worst batteries I\\'ve ever purchased. Not sure if these were manufactured second hand but more than half of the pack died within ONE USE. As a new mom who depends on the quality and longevity of a good battery for her child\\'s needs, I will never order this product ever again. I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!! I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I\\'ve used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery. These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them. These run down in my TV remote quicker than any battery I have used. TV says low battery within a week of installing. I will try another brand next time. Amazon, please keep an eye on quality and have your manufacturer test and give you results periodically. They will often provide good samples for evaluation early in production and then lower quality later. Amazon brand batteries are very poor quality. Don\\'t last more than 3 months in a remote control (which barely uses any power). This is shameful and stupid as it diminishes confidence in the Amazon brand name. The positive cap is just a little shorter than it\\'s supposed to be. That means battery holders which have shoulders built into them, the positive terminal doesn\\'t touch the contact. The Chinese find creative ways to cut corners to achieve the desired price point of the customer. They do not sacrifice profit...they sacrifice quality...they sacrifice quantity and they sacrifice material. Thanks China! Stopped working in less than 3 months. These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don\\'t waste your money. DO NOT PURCHASE! These batteries leaked in a machine I was using in my kids room to project stars on the ceiling. When I picked the projector up, it leaked battery fluid on me and burned my arms and legs. It could have gotten on my children! The leaking fluid also ruined the projector.The batteries were new, stored at room temp, used at room temp, not recharged, and not exposed to any fluid or abnormal conditions. Disposing in the appropriate manner.ETA: I was VERY happy with Amazon\\'s resolution despite this bad experience. Thanks Amazon... I\\'ll order batteries from you again. Just not your brand... Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time. With four kids under the roof, their toys are always in need of AA batteries. I had purchased this AmazonBasics pack of AA batteries for exactly that purpose. The expiration year reads 2024, but after just two years of sitting on the shelf, the batteries that are left are all but dead. They weren\\'t left in cold storage to freeze, they were right on the shelf in our living room. I ended-up going to Radio Shack and purchasing one of their batteries instead.I can only imagine that most of the 5-star reviews for this product are based off initial impressions and short-term use. It\\'s really sad that they just can\\'t hold their own after only two years. Will stick with known brands from now on. Bought a box of 36 aaa batteries and all batteries were dead. Don\\'t waste your money. The only way I rated it 1one star is because it would not except ZERO stars which is what this product deserves. None of these batteries had a full charge. My charge detector never reached the green zone. They were one half used up. This was true for the other two sizes D and AAA. All the batteries came dead. None of them worked. Don\\'t bother buying these. I got two of these batteries with my Fire TV stick. Loaded them in and everything was good for 1.5 days. Then the Fire TV stick stopped responding. I trouble shooted with no fix. Called customer service and they had me trouble shoot too, started by saying can you change the batteries.... my response ... seriously, you want me to change the batteries, it\\'s a freaking TV stick what could possibly be wrong, the batteries are brand new and came with the device. So I was changing the batteries as I was saying all that only for the new batteries to fix the problem. So.... these amazon batteries died in 1.5 days. How does that happen It\\'s seems as thought all of the batteries in the package are already dead. They are only lasting 3-4 days in the devices I\\'m putting them in. Fairly disappointed These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn\\'t work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window. The batteries were not operable out of the package. Thought it was the appliance, but replaced with other batteries and it worked fine. Luckily, Amazon\\'s return policy is amazing but I doubt I\\'ll try another one of their Basics brand items anytime soon. Defective and cheap. Only a third held any charge and those died super fast. We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life. Defective! All Amazon batteries I tried over the past year have been defectlve. Most too short. I have to constantly pull the spring, if the device has the spring, and roll the battery around to get it to work again. These are new batteries. Many of the batteries were thrown away because we thought they had been used up. It wasn\\'t until recently that we realized it was all the Amazon batteries that were causing the problem. I was on the phone with Amazon for two hours yesterday trying to get these orders straighten that out. I still have no confirmation that I do not have to send the batteries back because many went into the trash. I am now trying to use the batteries and basically they are not working. Perhaps they are old, but they are just plain not working. I put in a Duracell and my headphones work. I put any one of the 36 batteries in the headphones - and it is not working. It is not worth the effort to get my 10 back. These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. . Batteries dead as of June 1. I did not use half of then. Good for 6 months. We used in an August smart lock. We expected to get about 2-3 months of use based on the energizer batteries that came with the lock, but batteries died in 2 weeks. DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries! Ive gone thru half the box. Everyone of these batteries lasted for about 10 minutes and then died. Not happy at all! Wasted money on something i needed. I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you\\'d be better off buying a quality brand. They didn\\'t last long, do not waste your money!! Die quickly, most of them didn\\'t even work out of the package!! Hi ordered these thinking they were a great price, but sadly they die very quickly. these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for. these batteries died very quickly when compared to energizer or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life. run out super quick! would not buy again Cheap price but they sure don\\'t last very long. I won\\'t buy the Amazn brand again. Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it these batteries are terrible very disappointed. i have purchased before great long lasting very powerful. i must have received a bad batch they don\\'t last very long. i may not purchase again. Worked for one day, then stopped working. Can\\'t tell if it deterred any cats because it only went off when I walked by, but didn\\'t register the cats when they jumped on the counter.Would not recommend. The price was right but they just don\\'t last as long as the other name brand batteries so it\\'s not worth it. Sadly these batteries are horrible! I hardly ever have complaints about anything I order but these batteries barely have any power and I\\'ve had to change them out many times. These batteries literally only last 15 minutes inside of each device I put them in. When I researched the product, they told me the only way was to spend 50 on the recharger for these batteries. I personally do not buy batteries to have to spend more than what I spent on them in whole to have to buy a whole other product to recharge them. Worst amazon product I ever wasted my money on These batteries were a huge disappointment. I used two in my amazon tv remote and they lasted only 2 weeks. Usually, I only need to change batteries in that remote every 3-4 months or so. Total ripoff. I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time. These batteries are not lasting at all.... very short life on them... super disappointed... Spend a few more dollars and get a branded one. These discharge very fast. Had to keep changing my wall clock battery every 2 months when I had these. Got an energizer battery and that stayed for more than a year. Didn\\'t expect amazon product to be of such poor quality. DO NOT BUY. All batteries arrived completely dead. I thought it might be a bad batch. Ordered more, all arrived dead. I only have it one star because I couldn\\'t give zero stars. Over half of the box were dead. The ones that did work, only worked for a very short time. Do not buy these batteries. They didn\\'t work. Took one from each pack and - nothing! Went to pit them on for the first time and the strap behind the buckle broke. Never even got to wear them. Poor construction, cheaply made product. You get what you pay for.Lucky to get 2 weeks of minimum use. They went Dead before even using them.. The ones i used lasted maybe 4hours at best !!! Might as well be dead on arrival. Already burned through two sets of 4 of these since I ordered them less than two months ago on a Schlage keypad deadbolt lock. The previous batteries lasted over a year. I\\'ll never order another Amazon basics battery. Purchased these 3 months ago in addition to a higher end () brand that came with a 9 docket charger. The higher end rechargeables are still going strong. These leaked battery acid all over my charger and ruined one docket, and ruined an under cabinet puck light. Save your money! They won\\'t last! Bought these batteries thinking they were a good price. I have two deodorizer devices that spray a tiny amount every :20 minutes. I put these batteries in one and a brand name in the other. The name brand batteries have not been changed yet ant these batteries have gone through 4 pairs. Name brand are cheaper in the long run I don\\'t understand why these are rated so highly - these batteries DO NOT LAST. I have never experienced batteries that died so quickly....I used them from everything to my computer mouse to microphone and they lasted maybe about 1/4 the time of what I\\'m used to. I guess you get what you pay for - would never order these again They do not last long at all. I have to keep changing them out on the products I put them in. Will not be buying them again. I ordered a ton of these for holiday candle lights. They are in for 6 hours each night and turn off on a timer. We are 15 days in and every single candle (34 of them) is so dim you can barely see them.Expected to get far more life out of these. Do not recommend. They do not work. I had to buy Duracell These batteries started leaking right out of the box.I threw them in the trash and went back to Duracell. DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. What a disappointment. Threw them away. :( I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window. Literally the worst battery I\\'ve ever had. I\\'ve used them in different types of products and they are DEAD WITHIN A WEEK every time. Go to the dollar tree and save yourself some money and a headache After one use in a regular used battery powered item it\\'s dead. With other brand I can use the item several times before I have to replace the battery. These die SO fast. Put these batteries in led string lights on two wreaths, place kirkland batteries in another set of the same lights....guess what Amazon batteries loose their power quickly. Kirkland batteries are still flashing strong,,,,,,Amazon batteries barely blink. Sorry Amazon, love you but not these for me. These go dead very quickly. Not worth it if you rely on whatever the batteries are powering. Maybe ok for a remote control or something unimportant. Didn\\'t have hardly any charge to them. A total waste of money. These batteries don\\'t even work in a Amazon Firestick! Don\\'t Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results. Worst batteries for photographers. I\\'m sure they might be fine for using around the house, but for what I purchased them for (using with my external flash) these are the worst batteries I\\'ve ever used.Won\\'t purchase them again.The black ones that are supposed to be better are also horrible for photographers.Household use only. Never put a review online about a purchase , but this Amazon battery leak so badly I have to discard all of them after 2 weeks of use, DON\\'T BUY THIS ITEM .... These are, by, far, the worst batteries my family has ever purchased. They have all lasted less than one week and I\\'ve only used them in things that see usage a few times per week. None of them have seen more than 10 min total usage before needing replaced and q about a third of them have leaked or corroded worthiness a few days. I\\'ve had much better luck with dollar store brands. You get what you pay for here. These are cheap batteries and don\\'t last very long, I\\'d spend the extra and get rechargeables. I put two of these in my small flashlight and they only lasted about 15 minutes. Waste of money. I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use. Terrible. Don\\'t hold their charge, I change the batteries in my remote once a week. Will not be buying again. These are terrible. Don\\'t last Put then in various items and their life is only 1/2 half of a Duracell These have failed after a few weeks each time I\\'ve used them in my wireless keyboard. Duracells, on the other hand, have lasted for months. This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son\\'s toy train. I don\\'t know why but these things don\\'t last long. Maybe I don\\'t know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these. Batteries do not last at all. Worth just getting energizer batteries instead. These batteries don\\'t last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get. These batteries don\\'t last. They might be a good value but for me it\\'s more important to have a battery that lasts longer. Or use these for hiking and rockclimbing and working on my car in the middle the night if I have a flat tire. If you use them like that you want a much better battery like the name brands Duracell, energizer etc. If you just want something that\\'s cheap these batteries are definitely cheap but I bought the 60 count Duracell batteries for .36 each. I think the Amazon ones go for just a bit over .20 each. I think the Duracell\\'s last more than a third longer. They lasted less than 24 hours in my mouse and that includes turning the mouse off overnight! What a ripoff. I bought these batteries to charge my insulin pump - a life critical device. After I started using them, I found my pump worked terribly and after testing all other variables, popped out the Amazon battery and replaced with a Duracell, and everything was back to normal. I won\\'t use these again. I am very disappointed in these. I put them in my remote and within 24 hrs they are completely dead. For shame, Amazon. For shame. These are horrible! Don\\'t waste your money. These batteries die faster than any I\\'ve ever tried. A few hours in a Wii remote and they have to be replaced. I\\'m so disappointed! I like shopping with Amazon and have purchased several Amazon brand products. However, I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. I opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking. I threw those away. I need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it, there was no charge in the batteries at all. About half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival. The other ones had a charge but did not last long. Save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else. You will pay more but they work. I tried to return this pack but I was out of the 30 day window to return so I\\'m out the money. Worst battery I have ever came across. Don\\'t use for children\\'s toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over. Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn\\'t work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don\\'t workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible These batteries don\\'t last!!!! All but about 4 were duds. What a waste of money. Bought these in late Nov. By March 1, most of them were dead in the package. I was searching for rechargeable batteries and these came up. I did think it was a great price for rechargeable batteries so I bought two packs. Didn\\'t realize they were regular batteries until they arrived. I was a little annoyed. I blame Amazon for showing me these when I was looking for something else. The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kids can\\'t play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels. mu AA Amazon batteries made in Indonesia were without power after 12 months, bought in May 2016 When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It\\'s terrible. It\\'s also the first amazon product I didn\\'t like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I\\'ve ever seen. Did not work. Shame on Amazon for putting their trusted name on this garbage! Nothing I put these batteries work properly whether AA, AAA, C or D, not the blood pressure cup won\\'t fill with air before going into Error, motion lights that flicker when these are put in, remotes that work on and off - which all goes away with name brand batteries! When I purchased the Fire Stick, these batteries were included. In less than three weeks they were dead and had to be replaced. The batteries for the Fire Stick are used only in the remote, so it is not as though they got much use! I would never recommend such a garbage product. Bought a 20 pack to give them a try and found they dont hold up well in the tv remotes.... gone back to duracells By far the worst batteries I have ever bought I regret my purchase of 2 packs! Half of each box came without power and the ones that did were half life! If u found this helpful please rate helpful thanks! some are not functioning I got these batteries on Amazon Prime Day and I thought I got a good deal but half of them don\\'t work!!! Very disappointed. Half the batteries had no charge. I\\'m not sure if these are the same Amazon Basics batteries I purchased last time, the label is different. More importantly these seem to discharge faster or hold less power. I buy the 48 count box usually and its obvious to me already this box will last maybe half the time the last box did. absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free. Very unhappy with these batteries. Used them for my flame-less candles, 3 batteries in each. I use a remote to turn the candles on, so they were only on a few hours at a time AND only a few nights a week. Died in less than 3 WEEKS! I suppose the most honest thing about them is in their name...BASIC!! I use them in my blood pressure monitor. I take my BP twice a day and it only takes about 10 seconds. The batteries only last about 6 weeks. I\\'ve also used them in my air conditioner remote which I might use once or twice a day, just to turn it on or off. Again, after about 5 - 6 weeks, they stop working. They are also used in my Alexa/Echo remote which is used more often, yet, they last about 3 months in it. This is the first Amazon labeled/made product that I have bought that was not rated a 5. Don\\'t buy these if you are looking for a long lasting battery. Horrible, do not buy.I bought these in AA and AAA and they all lasted just a few days. My battery tester shows them on the lower side of good when unused but doesn\\'t take long before they stop working. Horrible! Did not last 1 hour, in my devices. DO NOT BUY!! Batteries were horrible. As soon as I would put a pair in my Amazon Fire stick remote, I\\'d get a message that batteries were low. After a day or 2 I couldn\\'t even wake the Fire stick up because the batteries were dead. Went through the hole pack in 2 weeks. I am very disappointed in these batteries. They do not work, or if they do work it is only for a few minutes. They are a waste of money. Not a long life at all. I bought AA batteries in the same order and they work fine. I bought the 20 pack in September 2015. Half of the batteries in the package do not work. Do not purchase. I bought these batteries for my Fitbit scale and installed them as soon as they arrived. Typically I have to change the batteries every 6-8 months but I have already had to replace these. I won\\'t be buying them again. Out of every package so far only 2 batteries are working. I bought these in April so they should still all be good and I\\'m finding I need to throw most of them away. I wish I could still return them. I DO NOT recommend purchasing these batteries they barely last 24 hrs in what lasts 2 weeks with Costco or Duracell or Energizer brands. I don\\'t know who made these batteries but they are worthless. They do not hold a charge.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN. I had hoped that Amazon batteries would be as good as their other services. Unfortunately, either we got a bad batch or these batteries are not as good as other brands. These were ordered in April and it is now August and I have had to use three sets of batteries in my mouse. Normally a set of batteries lasts three or four months. I would not recommend. Others reviews are more positive, but I personally cannot recommend this brand. I had to buy a brand new bed after purchasing this item. It kept ripping up and the bugs kept coming from the tears in the case. I do not recommend this for no one. These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received the batteries in the silver packaging, had no issues, long battery life, etc. The second order I received the batteries in the gray packaging as pictured. I bought the second back in April, and last week I discovered that every unused battery that I hadn\\'t used up and thrown out was leaking. I threw out 5 batteries one day, and found 3 more that were in use in remotes that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaked, and had to throw out a remote as well since it had corroded inside.I\\'m not going to be buying again. I could forgive one leaking battery, but almost half the package I\\'ll either buy another brand for a bit more money and quality, or go to a local dollar store for the same quality and less money I have never been so disappointed with a product. The battery life is horrible. When used in my camera, I can get maybe five standard-non zoom pictures before the camera shuts down and states the batteries need replaced. When used in tv remotes, the battery life is maybe a week. It is the same with the Amazon AAA batteries too. I will not be repurchasing again. I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won\\'t risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work. Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don\\'t last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn\\'t putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn\\'t replace quality. Won\\'t be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer. I need to cancel this auto shipment I needed batteries for my kittens toys. The first three I used lasted only 5 hours!! I am so unhappy, I spent 8 which is a lot of money for me. They do not last at all! I never leave negative reviews as I am generally satisfied. But logged back in just to do it! They are awful!!! I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA\\'s. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon\\'s expected standards. I will give it a miss. I purchased these batteries for my boyfriend . The split open and ruined who uses them in a 200.00 portable modem. I would of sent them back, but this happened after the 30 day return window. I purchased these for my daughter for camp and open a pack today and they did not work. Fresh out of the plastic wrap and everything:(. This is the first Amazon product I\\'ve purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can\\'t be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe\\'s. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can\\'t say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long. WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT\\'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE. I used them for christmas decoration and by the end of christmas the batteries leaked . will not get them again I will never purchase this item again. It is in my opinion overpriced junk. These batteries do not last nearly as long as the bunny or copper brands. I will use them up and never waste my time or money on these again. I have been using them in an LED flashlight. I see that these batteries have lots of positive reviews. My experience has been poor. I put a pair in the sensor for an outdoor thermometer. They lasted about 2 weeks and when tested, showed very low power. Replaced them with a second pair. They lasted and tested about the same. These may work better in indoor uses, but they seem to not like the cold. I\\'ve had way better success with rechargeable. They\\'re not a bad value (because they\\'re cheap), but they drain much faster than you would like. I hate throwing dead batteries away anyway (no recycling options here) and 4 of these drained in a day, running a tiny string of LED Christmas lights. I\\'ve had good luck with Amazon basics peripheral devices for computers, but the 24 pack of AAA batteries I got had virtually no power out of the package. Perhaps it\\'s a quality control issue, but I got burned on the ones I bought, and won\\'t take another chance with them. It stopped working. Never buy this. It\\'s not certified by Apple. Not sure why Amazon is selling such products on prime Lights worked well but the ahesive didnt stick on about 90 of the lights backing. The 10 that did. I tried to adjust the lights and they ripped. These batteries work but don\\'t really last that long. You maybe get 3-4 weeks out of them. Its better off buying rayovac or energizer batteries from home depot These batteries are junk . i use 4 of them in my front door lock. i have gone through 12 batteries in less than a month . Batteries used in fire remote, lasted maybe a week and then died batteries suck! brand new out of box dead or close too. Change smoke alarms every month and remote batteries every 2 weeks.junk dead, 3 different boxes and sizes of amazon Absolute junk! My devices run only 3 - 5 days with these batteries and probably half have been dead when I put them in my devices. Save your money buy Duracell batteries from Groupon they will stand behind less than quality batteries but Amazon will not once you buy Amazon batteries as has become the case with most of Amazon you are on your on without a paddle.Amazon did send me replacement batteries however they are the same as the original ones. I don\\'t know how anyone can give a positive review just terrible. I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn\\'t open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn\\'t unlock. I didn\\'t suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that\\'s all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren\\'t all created equal. Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. If they weren\\'t considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you\\'ll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they\\'re really not worth your time Lasted ten minutes in my flashlight. Changed out the batteries again, the next two lasted 12 minutes. Don\\'t buy. Junk! WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I\\'m throwing these away and will never trust this brand again. Do not buy each have leaked within one recharge. Battery corrosion at base ruined my battery recharger as well. Warranty for 30 days. You can\\'t use them all and recharge within 30 days Two batteries of he the twenty were leaking in the Package on delivery. With a ten year warranty against leakage...that is not a good start Half the box did not work and one set of 4 started leaking white battery acid within 5 minutes of putting it my sons toy. Asking Amazon for a full refund. Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn\\'t make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I\\'m talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children\\'s toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don\\'t buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined. Maybe we have a bad batch because all the other Amazon Basics batteries we have are great.. So far numerous AA batteries are leaking in remotes, toys, and other electronics. After 2nd recharge and use all but 3 are leaking corrosive fluid which has ruined my charger. I bought this product from amazon about a month ago, the reviews seemed great so I gave them a try.After using the batteries in my Xbox One controllers for about 2 weeks, the controller began to malfunction.Upon further inspection, I checked the batteries, and the compartment was a little bit wet, so I cleaned it up and went to get new batteries (still in the plastic wrapper) and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them (some type of leakage) .Overall, dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries. These batteries are the worst of any I\\'ve ever bought. They have corroded inside of toys, remotes, noise cancelling range headphones and an expensive gun scope that I own. I\\'ve tried AA and AAA, and even gave them multiple chances. The batteries in some electronic devices die within 24hrs. So needless to say, I have switched back to standard Duracell batteries. If you care about life and not having to mess with corrosion, do not buy these batteries!!! Never had alkalines that die as fast. This has been consistent through the package, not just a couple of batteries. Same results when used in TV remotes, optical mouse, smoke detectors and small flashlights. The batteries linked and ruined my Game Camera. I think you need to replace my game Camera They work but they don\\'t last they drain really quickly only had them about 2 weeks and they are almost all dead. Very frustrating will not be buying these again save your money and buy Duracell. love them work great but while charging they leaked all over the charger and had to just throw 8 of them away Used it for a mouse - works OK. I have a battery powered egg beater and when I put these batteries, the beater did not perform at full speed. I had some Duracell batteries which I used and it was back to life!!So, I guess these are low powered, Very disappointed Picture for proof. I had these in an Amazon basics wireless mouse and one of them exploded. It was only in there about 3 months before I noticed the batteries were dead. Upon inspection it was clear one of the batteries had a structural failure and exploded the end apart leaking fluid inside mouse.This mouse has NEVER been out of my air conditioned office.I have never had a battery explode inside a mouse before. These are obviously low quality. Do not put them into anything you\\'d be upset to ruin with leaky battery fluid. I love Amazon and Amazon products but....MAJOR disappointment. While not much less cost that Duracell or Energizer the Amazon brand batteries were a ripoff! Only lasted a third of the time in the devices I have used the competitor\\'s batteries in before.....bummer :( I\\'m not sure if it\\'s coincidence it not but two electronics we\\'ve put these batteries in have crapped out within a day of replacing the batteries. When I pulled them out of the remote that completely spazzed out, there was moisture on the batteries. I thought that may have been my fault but then it happened again with a Christmas decoration. I\\'ll probably return them...maybe a faulty batch May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid\\'s toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries. Great price but they don\\'t hold their charge for long. I find myself swapping out the remote batteries twice a year. At this price, it\\'s not so bad but it\\'s much more frequently that I\\'m used to. If I could give this 0 stars, I would. They all have problems working and the batteries have to be replaced after one use. Waste of time for what you get. More than 1/2 have been dead out of the box. Most other Amazon Basic products I have gotten have been great. Batteries have been beyond sub par so far. I need batteries that register 1.5V out of the box my camera flash remotes depend on it! NONE of the batteries I tested were more than 1.3V fresh out of the box. Unacceptable! Spend a few more bucks and get some decent name brand batteries. These are pathetic. Anyone need a 20-pack of 1.3V batteries SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far. Terrible! Didn\\'t last 2 weeks! ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BATTERIES IVE EVER USED AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL THEM Batteries do not last! Don\\'t waste your money on these. I\\'ve been using them in a weight scale where 4 batteries would last 4-6 months. With these batteries, I only get 10 days of usage. No battery life. Dead on arrival...please stay away. In a box of 12 batteries, 4 worked for 2 months, 8 did not work at all, Total waste of money Batteries popped open inside the motion detector lights making a mess and ruining the detector. I will never buy this brand again. Do not buy. Inconsistent quality, performance, some leak and ruin things. we will never buy any more!!!! they suck!!!!! Batteries died after a week. Same appliance used Duracell batteries for half a year. Good price.... but (update 12/21/2016)Update - horrible batteries. Have gone through 8 out of 48 batteries and none have worked. Contacted Amazon, they state they will refund my money and apologized. Great customer service,but horrible product.Be aware of the refund/return policy with Amazon. Batteries are something I don\\'t test when i get them, I assume they will work when I need them. Have never had a problem before now. When to put 2 AA\\'s in an LED flashlight..... nothing. Tried 2 more.... nothing. Tried 2 more....nothing 2 more (guess what)... nothing again. Tried it my TV remote too. Same results. Not something I would trust to stock up with for a power outage.While the product gets 1 star (that\\'s too generous) I do give Amazon and their Customer Service 5 Stars. I am giving these batteries a 1 star because I couldn\\'t go any lower. I tried 10 batteries in a row and they lasted bout 35 seconds then my light went out. The shelf life must have been ending. I guess the old addage You Get What You Paid For holds true. I like amazon products. But these haven\\'t worked in any thing I\\'ve put them in. Nerf gun, toys.. nothing. Maybe they work in remotes..... received the wrapping paper thank you.but no batteries ever came,nor were they in the package with my wrapping paper Im sure these are fine batteries, but they never arrived, and theres no way for me to request a replacement. They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn\\'t the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don\\'t work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas. Basic performance didnt last a week in an AM radio. 3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it\\'s to save time. This defeats that purpose. I bought these because of all the ratings on Amazon but they don\\'t last at all!! I am so disappointed. I used the in every device and every solar light and withing 2 months I have to replace them all. Now, with the the snow and cold, my yard is dark because I can\\'t get out there. I will never buy these again. Doesn\\'t last as advertised. Dead in no time! These are cheap and they Explode!!!!!! I was pumping at 2am and it exploxed in my pump. It leaked all over my pump and baby blankets!!!!! Ive never had this happen with name brand!!!!! Now I have to find time with a newborn to packed up all the batteries from all our baby items and return!! Not Cool!! I ordered these batteries 2 months ago. I don\\'t really have a lot of things that require AAA batteries. My tv remote finally died and I put in these batteries. And my remote tells me that these brand new batteries are low. Ordered the Triple AAA battery pack and I\\'m not sure if I got a bad batch or what but pretty much not a single battery works. What a waste of money so they definitely deserve one star. Gave these a fair chance but the fact is they simply do not last as long as Duracells. I\\'ve gone through more than half of the pack I purchased and I am easily replacing batteries twice as fast for the same devices, same use. I won\\'t repurchase. Some work, some don\\'t. Some will power my TV remote but the same batteries wouldn\\'t power a different type of remote. I won\\'t buy these again. Not suitable for toys. Drained within just a couple of days. Not sure I will be buying these again. The first four pack I opened was dead. The second pack worked but only lasted half the time a name brand battery lasts. I am using more batteries for the same amount of use in my headset. I won\\'t be buying these again. I have bought these several times thinking they were great but after longer term use have found they fail about twice as fast as Duracell. I will never buy them again and will not hold Amazon Basic in such A high standard. my next batteries will be Duracell What\\'s happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don\\'t last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They\\'re just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn\\'t seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!! Worst batteries I have ever purchased. I use in the mouse to my laptop. Doesn\\'t hold a charge for more than three days with limited usage (maybe 4 hours/day). Not worth the price. On second use, silver liquid leaked out of batteries, almost ruining the motor of a breast pump. Every time I brew a cup off coffee there are tons of coffee grinds in my coffee. I have cleaned my pot several times. Thank god I only have a few pods left. Will never buy this brand again!!! Overpriced, works about the same as raovac. Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries. Was very disappointed to see that one of my batteries corroded and leaked in a device within only a few days of placing it in the device. Will not purchase again. Bought these because I had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generics and get comparable quality to name brands. It is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage. These, after a year, would begin leaking soon after installing them. That is, they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days. They fouled up a few things, one of which was a good work flashlight. I hadn\\'t seen a battery leak in decades. I had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good. 5 of the batteries leaked from the package. Will not buy these again. About 1/3 the life of energized or Duracell batteries. All were dead Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak amazon sucks these batteries drain like the water in my toilet As soon as i place the new battery in my card alarm, ut says 1 bar charged Awful batteries don\\'t work Awful batteries. bad product, not working in the remote car where it required 3 AA batteries. Batteries arrived drained. all of them. Batteries did not last more than two days Batteries didn\\'t last long at all batteries didnt even last one month...very dissapointed Batteries die super fast! Batteries last for about 2 days in my Xbox one controller. batteries used primarily for remotes, batteries last for about 1 month Batteries very week. Would Not Work IN Several devices. Batteries were weak and didn\\'t last a week in remote Battery blew up in the charger. Returned product for full refund. Better at the dollar store no matter what the brand Booooo Broke about a month after ordering them. BRUTAL! THEY DONT LAST LONG AT ALL! Cheap Did not fix my leaking water pump die after one hour of use Die way too fast Died almost immediately. Ruined their purpose for the purpose needed. do not last long at all - never by these again Do not last near as long as other \\'off brand\\' batteries Does not last as long as the good batteries doesn\\'t last like the other brands Don\\'t buy. Don\\'t last! don\\'t hold a charge - have to recharge too frequently don\\'t last long. Replace batteries in my clock almost every 2 months. Don\\'t last! Don\\'t seem to last as long as Duracell...Wouldn\\'t buy them again don\\'t seem to last very long Don\\'t waste your money. They last about 2 days in a wii remote. Entire pack of batteries was dead! garbage Good price with ugly design. Great price but these do not last very long. Half of the batteries received were dead and there is no replace option. I feel like the batteries wasted quickly. It did not last as long as store bought batteries. I have the wrong size batteries i like amazon product.but this battery was not good. I ordered AA I used them for my Xbox 1 controllers. They do not last long compared to name brands. Idk why I ended up with AAA, when I orderd AA... Oh well Inconsistent. VERY short life. It didn\\'t last for even one day, It goes off in week. Junk wont charge Junk, they don\\'t work life of the batteries do not last LOVE THE BATTERIES.THANKS More than half did not work More then half did not work :( never again. don\\'t last. especially short life in cold weather. None of them would recharge. not good at all Not happy at all very slow compare to others I ordered Not universal. Did not work on garage door opener, given as gift but now cannot return. Pretty sure they didn\\'t really have a charge when they arrived Really good price for a reason, first two batteries I used were dead. Do not waste your money! Save your money,these do not last half the time of Duracell Sent me old dead batteries should buy duracell Substandard...Dollar store batteries last longer terrible The capacity is suspect. I seem to have gotten a lot more out of Energizer. The products that it was delivered but I could not find it anywhere These are absolute junk. I\\'m half way through the pack and so far every single battery has leaked.UPDATE:Ok, these batteries are horrible. Every single battery leaked, ruining some of the items they were in. In almost 30 years of buying from Amazon these batteries are the most disappointing thing thing I\\'ve ever received.Amazon, in case you are interested the lot number is JK150601 These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity. These batteries are awful, have no power and die fast These batteries do not come close to duracel in terms of longevity. These batteries do not last or work well. Spend the extra buck and buy Duracell. these batteries do not perform as good as the cheapest ones on the market. these batteries don\\'t last very long these batteries explode - terrible quality These batteries have a very short life. Need replaced every week. Used ina solar light outside Very unsatisfactory These batteries have an extremely short life. Below Amazon\\'s standards. These batteries suck!!!!!!Stay away from them! Read bad reviews, they last only weeks. These did not fit my device... These did not last long at all. These die way too fast. These do not last long. Will never buy again These suck. Had for a week. Stopped working. Garbage. these were dead on arrival theses batteries don\\'t last very long not worth the money they are not good as described. the power is easy to be used out. they are terrible They are too cheap, please buy rechargeable batteries instead of wasting the environment! They die quickly They do not last they don\\'t hold a charge like the top brands do. They don\\'t hold a charge very well. They don\\'t last. I would not buy again They don\\'t work and are dead!!!!!! They fail earlier than brand names. I assumed Amazon would match in beat others. I won\\'t order again. they let for about 5 recharges They lost power within minutes in digital cameras. They paired these with a order that uses AA They were dead. I\\'m baffled. This is not what I received. took WAY to long to receive. and then some were corroded. Tore within one week and is baby blue and very shear not green. Trash. Only lasted a few hours. Tried them in 2 flashlights. Neither worked. Used these for 2 insta bulb lights purchased from here also and they last about a week. Crazy!!! Utterly worthless, no staying power. very cheap batteries very disappointed in these! Very dissappintes with these. Have had to replace almost all of them. Very weak batteries Wore out way to fast Worst batteries ever....they work once and drain out...you try to use something again and the battery is dead! Worst batteries I\\'ve ever bought. Worst battery I\\'ve ever used. Lasts 1/3 as long as eveready!!! Wrong Item Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time. I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don\\'t buy these. NOT MUCH POWER IN THESE BATTS I waited to write this review until I had tried nearly all of the batteries that I ordered. Most of them did not have any power in them. The few that did work lasted maybe an hour. I pitched the remaining 6 because I cannot depend on them at this point. Maybe I just got a bad batch but these are the worst collection batteries I have ever used. I would not recommend these to anyone else based on my experience. These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk I didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate. It was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket. Then a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufators use the same controler design) and i hsve no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. We lost the reciever after a few weeks. It might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days. Now I know why these are so inexpensive! I\\'m baffled as to how they\\'ve earned such high reviews. I\\'ve used them in a variety of devices portable LED lights that I utilize maybe once every two months for events, in a battery-operated soap-dispenser, in tap lights in a closet/hallway, in toys... In the soap-dispenser, they lasted three weeks. I thought the dispenser must be faulty, switched them out. Next set of these batteries lasted a week. In the LED lights, the batteries lasted five hours. Less in the toys and tap lights. At this rate, I\\'ll have used the whole box of 20 batteries in less than 6 months. What a wasteful, useless product! After receiving this box of batteries, as we made our way through them, we realized that the batteries were all close to dead. Now we are past the return date. Not buying these again. Would give zero star rating if I could. I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy. Nope. I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about 13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck! Batteries leaked when in charging station. These batteries are very poor quality and do not last even half the time of standard Energizer or Duracell batteries Horrible quality. These last 4 to 6 days in an Xbox controller and maybe 10 days in a remote. Horrible quality. these are junk. you get a large quantity but they are not long-lasting and sometimes need to be changed after only a few hours of continuous use.i do not recommend these and will not purchase them again. Bought these and regret it. I must have gotten a bad batch since these were lasting only three weeks in my smoke detectors. After a few weeks, all smoke detectors using them started beeping like they are low on power. A battery tester confirmed the batteries were low. I replaced them with store-bought Rayovac batteries and haven\\'t had any issues. Your milage may vary. My milage is after being recharged less than ten times, two different sets of the batteries rapidly lost capacity to hold charge (from full to empty in 30 seconds) and leaked, each time in a different devices, damaging at least one of them.. I\\'m hesitant to try any more of them.My opinion garbage.I have been using rechargeable batteries for years. Frys\\' no name, Energizer and Duracell all worked great. The AmazonBasics are no where near the level of the these brands in regards to quality. Multiple batteries leaked, ruining one toy and causing messes in other items. Poor quality. I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won\\'t last mare than a week in my TV remote. Pretty annoying! This is sth i never had with other serious brands. disappointing and returning Trying to contact seller. Product very tarnished and rusty like it\\'s been used or very old. Very disappointed by appearance and quality purchased in sept 2015 went to change because light was not working . batteries leaked and ruined a special optical light . now checking all other light they are in . Put these into a high power flashlight and took my dog out. Within ten minutes the flashlight was so dim that it was worthless. I would never buy these again! I Ordered these to use in my flashes to shoot a wedding. They are with out a doubt the worst batteries I\\'ve ever used. They\\'d last for maybe 30 to 40 shots, and they would start to over heat. I have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot, they would burn you.Typically I can run though a wedding with energizer batters (4 AA) and only have to swap batteries once. I went through this entire pack, and had to go buy more at a store. Which the ones I bought later caused no issues and finished out the night.Very displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with. I will never buy these again. I purchased an 8-pack back in April. I used 2 right away in a remote and put the remaining 6 up in a cabinet. Last night (3 months later) I went to replace batteries in another remote and all 6 were dead. I purchased another box of batteries from a local store, installed them in the remote the remote worked great. Definitely a quality issue on some of these batteries based on other reviews. These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same... Junk...save your money... totally useless batteries that last hours if that. These batteries leak not satisfied! Ordered these for my son\\'s remote control truck. Put them in both trucks and within a week the batteries in both trucks exploded, ruining both of them. So not only am I out the money I spent on the batteries I have to buy a new truck that costs 50. Spend the extra money and buy Duracell! Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don\\'t last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved. Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. Out of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with. short battery life These things only last about a week in a Roku remote I will not be reordering. Batteries last about a week in a wall clock- name brands last six months. Don\\'t waste your money. We have been extremely disappointed in these batteries. Put them in our game camera and they were dead after two weeks. Should have lasted two or three months. Same thing with everything we have used these batteries for. Don\\'t waste your money, Buy Duracell instead. I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it. In Firestick remote it lasts about a week before replacement is required. Digging deeper alkaline batteries only last as long as they retain the upper percentage of their voltage. Either I have a bad batch or these degrade quickly in remotes. I plan on asking Amazon why this basic is so short lived in peak voltage retention. Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one. I don\\'t know if I got a bad batch, but I\\'m getting less than two week\\'s of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I\\'m pretty appalled at how short these. I\\'m in San Francisco and it doesn\\'t get that cold so I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.I\\'ve tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won\\'t drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die. I use AA batteries in my double electric breast pump. I usually have to replace Duracell every 3-4 days but these I had to replace every 24 hours or so. Truly did not last long! SO BAD DO NOT EVEN LAST TWO MONTHS IN A MOUSE....A MOUSE!!!!!That\\'s what I call utter garbage. Would return if possible. Dollar store Sunbeam batteries lasted longer than these crappy things. So disappointing! So, I saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for 48 of this alkaline batteries. Yeah, well, NOW I am startled by how long they last. Uh-oh, make that DON\\'T last. I don\\'t take but 20 to 30 shots from my little Finepix camera before the lens starts closing when I try to shoot. Compare that to...well, I\\'m not gonna lie. I never counted, but I took TONS of shots using Duracell alkaline bats. Conservative estimate At least 300 shots for each set of two. Einstein not needed to do the math on that. I just looked and see that they are made in Indonesia, which may or may not matter, since I don\\'t know where Duracells are made. I still have 34 of these lousy things left. Ticks me off, royally!!!(Now, let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase. I\\'ll give them two stars for the price, but you really do get what you pay for. These batteries seemed to die a lot faster than the Kirkland ones I got from Costco. Or, maybe it\\'s just some of them that fail too soon. I put several new Amazon AA batteries in a few different devices that get a good amount of use. When a couple of those devices stopped working, I tested the batteries. In both cases, only one battery was actually dead, the other was fine. That seems weird, weird enough that I\\'ll go back to Costco for my next battery purchase. These don\\'t last long, wouldn\\'t buy again. Spend the extra money get good batteries. Update 4/30/16:I\\'ve been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn\\'t want to just throw them out but at this point is isn\\'t worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that\\'s usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won\\'t buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess. These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA\\'s a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt. Lasted less than half the time of a Duracell alkaline battery in the same conditions. (LED candles, on continuously). Of the 6 I used so far, out of the box and wrapper, completely dead... thanks... Arrived and maybe only 1/3 of the batteries actually worked. The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all. I went through all 48 in less than 2 weeks. I can\\'t lie and say they were awesome, when they were not. Terrible - The product lasts less than a week in a home weather station, regardless if warm or cold weather. Cheap Rayovac batteries work just fine and I will stick with buying those locally at Menards. Worst batteries I\\'ve ever used. I used them in a sensor light. They only worked l l/2 months while my prior Energizer batteries had worked for 5 l/2 months. I can see why these batteries are so cheap. I definitely would NOT recommend them to anyone. Terrible decision on my part to trust Amazon to make even a decent battery. How hard can it be, right Batteries don\\'t last. Every device I\\'ve used them in began to have quirky little malfunctions (remote buttons don\\'t always work or do what they are supposed to do, mouse randomly disconnects from computer, etc.). Maybe I got a bad batch -- all 48 of them. Lesson learned. I tried using these on my mini mist diffuser, amazon basics batteries discharges easily within a week. This is terrible in comparison to energizer batteries which lasts at least 3 months. Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote. Terrible!! The batteries drained way too fast. We put them in wreaths with lights and went dead within 2 days. They were timed for 4 hours so it\\'s not on for long. We used Energizer batteries last year and worked for the 20 days that were on display and didn\\'t have to change any. But I guess for 24 for 100 you get what you pay for. Will not buy these again. The batteries are the very worst I have ever used. I use a wireless mouse for work, and I\\'ve had to replace the battery every 2 weeks, instead of once a year like my old batteries. By the time you figure out how bad they are, you will be outside your return window. A fail for Amazon if you ask me, and makes me question whether I should keep shopping with them. The batteries had very short life. Long time fan of Amazon.com, first time buyer of Amazon brand batteries. Replaced batteries in a digital clock. After about 3 months (I bought the batteries in August, and now it\\'s November), the batteries were dead. I have had this clock for years and never had any brand of batteries that lasted so short. I opened up this package fresh and put two AA batteries in my Xbox one controller. It only lasted for a few hours of gameplay. When I took the batteries out they seem quite warm. I used my heat gun and they were 115F. I got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller. They only kept the controller on for less than a minute. When I took the batteries out one burned my finger. I grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over 127I\\'m not going to try and use anymore in any electronics. I\\'m not sure what\\'s going on here Amazon. I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn\\'t work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn\\'t work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I\\'m going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again. The charge is really bad. I used them all up super quick because they don\\'t last. Will not buy again. The package was open and had no batteries.... The quality of Amazon AA battery is going down. Now just after a few weeks, even when it shows full power from battery power meter, the Amazon battery cannot be used in many appliances. (bluetooth keyboard, soap dispenser...) I was excited about the prices of these batteries, however you get what you pay for. These batteries are awful. I\\'ve used them in toys, remotes, and flashlights. The remote lasted for like a week! I used the flashlight for a few minutes and that\\'s all the use I got out of them. I unsubscribed to this item. No thanks. The worst batteries that i have ever purchased. DON\\'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Dont hold a charge for long and you have to buy Amazon\\'s rechargeable pack. Doesnt work with otber brands but doesnt work with amazons either. I got this huge box and about 6 (yes, 6) actually recharge. Spend the money on duracell or energizer. I have a 4 pack of durcell with a charger and still works after years of recharging Worst batteries I have ever purchased - bought them for Christmas items like battery operated lights and candles but they didn\\'t last even a week with limited usage. Spend a little more and get more for your and time, it\\'ll save you in the long run! Bought these batteries because of the 4 - 5 star ratings from verified purchases.....what These are the worst batteries I\\'ve ever used! 1 week of these batteries 1 month or more of brand name batteries. The batteries suck. I have them in my mouse and I have to replace them every week. My Duracell\\'s would last a month. I feel like they are only 1/2 charged, I put new ones in my flash for my high quality camera, and the flash was really slow and dim. Pretty crappy for new batteries. I am not pleased These batteries are terrible. All of my clocks (bought in this same order) need new batteries already because they are all dying. I now have to buy all Energizer batteries. :-( There is no place to contact seller THESE batteries are the worst ! The last two days to a week. I would like a refund! These batteries are the worst. They leak and they die ridiculously fast. I\\'ve replaced the battery in my kitchen clock twice in the past month. They last about 6 hours of use in a Wii remote. I usually like the amazon basics brand, but these batteries were a total waste. These batteries come very low charged. I took new batteries and put them in a computer mouse. Next day there was a Mouse Battery is very Low. Its not the first time. I bought these for my cameras. They don\\'t last any time at all. I won\\'t buy these again. These batteries last about 25 of a stander energizer! Dont be suckered in by the price..... WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN! Please be aware that these batteries leak! I put these in a few electric candles and alarm clocks in our house, after a few days the bottom of the candles and clocks were coated with battery acid. No other battery brands have done this in our house before. I cannot tell you if they last long or not, got rid of them immediately. These don\\'t seem to last very long at all. I used them on my light in chicken coop. I replace once a week and only used it 2 or three times each week. Very dissapointed in this purchase. I usually buy our batteries from Costco. These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I\\'ve used! I should send back.. I thought I was getting a deal when I saw these batteries. Unfortunately, they died after two weeks. I do not recommend buying this brand. Worst performance in AA alkaline batteries we have ever seen. We bought these for use in our manufacturing company, and we used them in a wide variety of applications. Everyone has had poor performance. For clocks that used to have batteries last three years, this brand lasted only several weeks. Same problems when used in a computer mouse by several people, laser pointers, and other applications. We are going back to name-brand AA batteries. This is the worst rating I have given any product in a long time. They don\\'t last. USed in electronics (like computer mice, computer keyboards) Energizer or Duracell last easily 3x longer. Not worth the savings. If its going in some kids game or infrequent use (where the battery would be dead later anyways) ok. They don\\'t seem to last that long as the ones you can get off the store. I bought them because I thought they were cheaper but Sam\\'s club sells them cheaper and they last much longer.Update 1/10/2017Not only do they not last long but the new batteries that say are good till 11/2018 are pretty much dead without any use.Highly disappointed in amazon for this. They don\\'t seem to work except in very low energy items. Can\\'t get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well Mine don\\'t appear to have a charge. I bought them for a plant watering system that takes AAA batteries. I tried three sets of these AAA batteries in the plant watering system, which works fine currently with rechargeable batteries. They alkaline performance batteries don\\'t work.I was hoping to get longer battery life from these performance batteries but they don\\'t work at all. They don\\'t work. Still to regular brands. These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality. We tried these batteries out but they\\'re trash. They lasted only 2-3 weeks in our tivo remotes which is amazing as we don\\'t watch that much tv. These batteries leak. What more is there to say They are the worst. Do not buy these. DO NOT BUY THEM.I got them because it said they were anti leakage. Well guess what.they leaked!!, completely destroyed my keyboard and I cant even open it up to get the batteries out. A waste of money and will also cost me a whooping 100 for a new keyboard and I cant use my desktop until I get a new keyboard. Very poor batteries. I ordered a box and so far about 50 are either bad out of the box or very soon after. Junk - after trying 10 batteries one worked! Hardly last as long as a stick match. Total waste of money. untrustworthy...dies really quick and doesn\\'t keep the delivery date. Do NOT waste your money on these. I bought a box of 48 in November of 2015. It is now March of 2016, and we\\'ve used about a third of them. The rest are all dead already. 10-year shelf life!!! ... nowhere close. DO not buy this product I\\'ve received this product to replace batteries in remote-control candles all three candles did not work I was ready to discard the candles when I decided to try different batteries. As soon as I put the different batteries from another company the candles worked fine. Tried to find a place to write to the seller but couldn\\'t so apparently I\\'m just stuck for the price of the batteries which are useless!!!!! I would give it zero stars if possible. Every single battery came dead. Every. Single. One. Completely useless and a waste of time to try and fight for a refund. Usually I have great faith in AmazonBasics, but now I\\'m not so sure. I hoped that an Amazon-branded product would have decent quality, but these batteries are just terrible. Their charge will last for about 1/10 of the usual top brands. Very disappointed. I\\'m never buying an Amazon battery again. I was super bummed about these! I purchased them exactly 3 months ago today. I only used 8 batteries when they arrived, and they have all started to die this week already. When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! So to recap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even usable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users. My Mother in Law owns a home decor store with a lot of battery operated things like clocks, etc. We ordered these for her and she spent hours putting them in things all around the store. Once they were on they only lasted about 30 minutes. She then had to go back and take them all out and go out and buy different batteries. Really disappointing and a huge hassle for her. Have never had batteries last such a short time. We were very unhappy. Not sure why they won\\'t recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name. The batteries I got have very little charge left in them. 2 batteries only lasted 2 days in my Wii remote, whereas other batteries lasted weeks. V All 20 of the batteries are dead (no power). Very disappointed to receive a product with Amazon\\'s name on it that is useless, especially as a Prime member. Many of these batteries are not working at all. Very disappointed. First eight batteries I tried barely had a charge at all! Don\\'t wast your money. Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I\\'ve had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that\\'s about it. Don\\'t last long at all. I\\'ve had better luck with cheaper batteries than I\\'ve had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did. These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can\\'t believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these. Lot\\'s of claims in the description and lots of good reviews here, so I don\\'t know what went wrong, but it appears these batteries really stink.In a TV remote, a pair of these batteries lasted 2 weeks. The name-brand batteries they replaced had lasted several months.In an LED flashlight, a pair of these batteries lasted exactly 2 uses before the light got dim and 3 uses before the batteries were totally dead. I\\'m talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don\\'t know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations. Either way, back to name-brand batteries for me. Horrible. Amazon batteries are the WORST!! I have a battery operated little decorative light string. 2 Duracell batteries will light those things for weeks. 2 amazon batteries last about (and I\\'m not kidding) maybe 4 hours. Complete waist of money. Dollar store batteries are better. Do NOT purchase these Four in the batch leaked and caused a mess in my charger and device. I threw out the remaining to avoid future problems. In addition, the batteries didn\\'t hold their charge. I presume I must have received a bad batch based on all the positive reviews. I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. Pay a little more for quality batteries that work. Spend the money and buy a name brand. These seriously do not work at all. Such a waste of money These batteries DO NOT last. They are a waste of money. These batteries don\\'t last long. Waste of money. These batteries last 5 minutes. Waste of money. I just open several new, cello packs to use in a motorized window shade cartridge. Loaded them up, plugged the cartridge in - nothing. Took the batteries out and checked each one in a battery tester. 3 of the 12 batteries were good. I opened up several more new packages and tested them before loading them into the cartridge. One out of every five had a charge, and the ones that had a charge were not strong charges. The rest are going to battery recycling. When it comes to batteries, you get what you pay for. These are awful. So far I\\'ve used them in my toothbrush, and have had to replace them 3 times in 6 months. I\\'ve also used them in my smoke detector and had to replace them within that 6 month period as well. Seriously I usually can go a few years without replacing batteries in a smoke detector. Waste of money. Terrible batteriesDon\\'t last longDon\\'t depend on theseYou\\'re better off buying batteries at the dollar store then here Stopped working after 6 months. Had to throw them away. What a waste. Have tried these in various battery powered devices and they fail very quickly. I won\\'t use them any more as I don\\'t like having to dispose of dead batteries They perform well and the price is fine, but it\\'s not entirely clear when it automatically switches you to AA size when you choose the larger quantity. Amazon snuck in a box of AA on me that way when I was expecting these AAA. Bad, Amazon. Bad. We buy a lot of batteries and was hoping we had a way to get them to us. Theseas as long as the dollar store batteries. Some items 2 weeks, others 1. I will not buy again. we have had nothing but trouble with these batteries. i have installed them in multiple products and they are barely lasting any time at all. we will not be buying these again. maybe amazon can provide us with a new batch as maybe we just got unlucky with ours. They\\'re not strong enough to power my kids\\' toys... so far they only work with tv remotes. :( These batteries are fairly priced for their quality. Which is to say, they need replacing 4 or 5 times more often than a name brand battery. These worked for about 8 hours and then were dead. What a waste! I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I\\'ve been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I\\'ve used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it\\'s rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they\\'re actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it\\'s time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I\\'m not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors. If the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I\\'ll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the 4th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contacting Amazon Customer Service. As I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name. What happened to the green and silver amazon batteries Those worked great. These new ones are terrible. Very short battery life. I\\'ve been through two boxes of 48, thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time, same results. Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. My experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product. These batteries only last 2-3 days in my tv remote Cheap batteries poor performance. I put two in our Roku remote and they died within a day. Same thing happened with the TV remote. Put these AA batteries in smoke detectors and they immediately start the low battery beeps. Pulled them back out going to see about returning them all - or they will goto recycling. :-( I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my flameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. None of those worked either So I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don\\'t understand. Worst batteries ever. I bought these and put them in the drawer till needed. I have thrown out every single one trying to find 3 that work. WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline I don\\'t even want to give this a star, worst batteries ever, lasted 15 minutes top. Do not buy Shortest life batteries ever, waste of money Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell\\'s in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell\\'s they will same you money in the long run. These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn\\'t return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME. Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn\\'t turn on the receiver. The AA\\'s I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA\\'s didn\\'t last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we\\'ll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries ! These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don\\'t know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order. These batteries are the worst batteries I\\'ve ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I\\'ve since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I\\'ll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future. What went wrong These are the worst AAA batteries I\\'ve ever purchased. Make that the worst batteries ever purchased. I\\'ve used over half of them so far and I\\'m getting about 25 of the life I previously got from Duracell and other brand names. Our experience with all Amazon batteries have been bad. They dont last nearly as long as a Duracel or Energizer. I literally replaced my computer mouse battery with an Amazon AAA battery 2 days ago and its already out. We have to replace everything that has an Amazon battery constantly. Will not buy these again. Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again. Worst product. Have to trash it out, because I was so upset. Did not serve the propose I bought it for. I will never purchase batteries online ever again! I should have never believed that this is Unique Japanese technology that enables better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures, because frankly IT DID NOT EVEN LAST FOR TWO DAYS FOR MY DIGITAL CLOCK THAT HAS FOUR PLACEMENTS OF AAA BATTERIES. At first I believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries, no problem, THEN, a week and a half has passed and I had to change the batteries for my clock FIVE TIMES! I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn\\'t make a big deal out of it, but it is frustrating to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product. Well that\\'s that, have a good one! Wrong size!! Just awful. Not worth money you certainly get what you pay for....I bought these because the cost was about half of what I pay for name brand batteries. They last about 25 as long as the brand batteries. Hmmmm...paid half for something that lasts one quarter......My financial advisor is still wagging his finger at me Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA\\'s for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don\\'t last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries. Everyone read the 1 star reviews..the 5 star reviews must be people reviewing immediately. The 10 year promise is crap. I have 48 AA and 36 AAA batteries that are all dead after 1 year. The Dollar Tree batteries are better. Pay the extra money and don\\'t fall for Amazons broken promises or guarantees. The battery life is much poorer compared to name brands like energizer and Duracell. I find these batteries fail in a short time on items like wireless thermometers and wall clocks. On an average changing is required within a month. I would not purchase these again. 3 of them exploted and damage my charger that I bought here what is going to happen with my charger not satisfied with the batteries These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That\\'s a 1/4 capacity. These don\\'t last long at all. WORST batteries EVER. I thought there would be no appreciable difference between these and Duracell. I was wrong. Mouse was VERY sluggish and would sometimes stop working with these batteries. Replacing them with another set of these batteries did not help. My husband thought the computer had a virus. Problem SOLVED with Duracell. I will not be purchasing these batteries again. Amazon FAIL. Approximately half of the batteries I\\'ve tried so far are dead. Low expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again. Died after 5 uses in my coffee frother wand. Won\\'t buy again. These are bad batteries with very short life. I returned my first order assuming that I got a bad batch (despite the expiration date years away). Started using the replacement order in late May and already have to replace the batteries.I love Amazon Basics products and Amazon service but this product is a big dud. This is the first negative review I\\'ve ever written about a product on Amazon. Wrong item. These batteries are bad. In any device the last only a very short time. Many of the batteries are no good. Wish I didn\\'t buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand. It states that the batteries last a while. But I use them for my TV remotes. And I ended up buying Energizer a few days later. They do not last. I changed batteries twice the day I got them in mail.The triple A were no better. Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won\\'t make this mistake again. Batteries are larger than normal and do not fit my audio gear or guitars... if you need these for sound or audio I\\'d pass... These do not last at all. I have a very mini desk fan that takes 4 AA and they need to be changed every other day. These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years. This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days. Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again 2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up. Some of the unused batteries stored in AC room show signs of deterioration within six months of purchase. Poor battery performance Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat. Gave these batteries a shot, because we\\'ve had great luck with AmazonBasics products. I just purchased the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. These batteries do not last. I have a flashlight that uses 4 AAA batteries, and have gone through 8 batteries in a one week span. These die very quickly. I have had a similar experience with the AA batteries on a wireless Mac keyboard. Would not recommend these batteries. Low quality batteries - they die after using a few times. Better to go with big brand name I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death! bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture. Bought these for my sisters day care. She said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these Not good. Don\\'t last a week. I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!! Batteries die quicker than Dollar store batteries. Used these batteries on various products -toothbrush, computer mouse, camera flash, etc. Batteries at best lasted half as much compared to Energizer and Duracell. Would not recommend! These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them. These batteries leak easily and I found them hard to insert into a toy that required AAA. Did not have this problem when I switched them with brand name batteries. These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don\\'t waste your money. These are the worst batteries i have ever bought. Two days in my remote for tv and replaced and 2 days later,dead. Im very dissappointed with you Amazon for selling this to me. Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time. These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn\\'t work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window. Defective and cheap. Only a third held any charge and those died super fast. We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life. I put two of these batteries in my wireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out. I will throw the rest of them away and NEVER buy these again.I know I\\'ll never get my money back. I\\'ll just write it off as a lesson learned. These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. . DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries! I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you\\'d be better off buying a quality brand. these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for. these batteries died very quickly when compared to energizer or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life. the last time i had batteries go dead so soon were the ones i purchased at harbor freight.. i had to change the batteries in a comcast remote every 2 weels and in my digital camera , without the flash after 20 shots.. Cheap price but they sure don\\'t last very long. I won\\'t buy the Amazn brand again. Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it Don\\'t bother. The AA\\'s I bought got remotes last a third as long as everready batteries. Worked for one day, then stopped working. Can\\'t tell if it deterred any cats because it only went off when I walked by, but didn\\'t register the cats when they jumped on the counter.Would not recommend. I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time. DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. What a disappointment. Threw them away. :( I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window. Don\\'t Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results. These straight up don\\'t work. I have put 6 different, brand new batteries from this pack into a controller and none of them have worked. Steer clear. Great deal price wise but don\\'t seem to last very long at all. So really not a good deal at all. Would not buy again. This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son\\'s toy train. I don\\'t know why but these things don\\'t last long. Maybe I don\\'t know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these. These batteries don\\'t last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get. Disappointed... In my handheld Microsoft wireless game controller these last about 1 week. Duracell/Energizers last 3-4 weeks... Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Prime. Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell. DON\\'T PUT THESE IN ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE... like smoke detectors, emergency flashlights and radios. These batteries are supposed to be 1.5 volts. But I opened and tried to use them as soon as I got them and had problems.I checked the batteries and they only had 1.25 volts upon delivery and of course they are non returnable.Don\\'t waste your money on these, go ahead and pay a little more and get the popular name brands. Awful. Bought these specifically for my very small milk frother, these batteries can barely power the thing! I used whatever name brand in the frother before this and it ran full blast. But with the Amazon batteries, it gets up to like medium speed and doesn\\'t even last 1/2 as long. Will never buy Amazon batteries again. Very, very, very difficult to turn on and off, not sticky enough and kept falling down, complete waste of money.When I could get them on and they were sticking, the lighting effect was very nice however, the quality of the product was zero. Worst battery I have ever came across. Don\\'t use for children\\'s toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over. Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn\\'t work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don\\'t workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible I\\'ve only found 2 out of the box that have lasted longer than a week! Went cheap...got cheap. DO NOT BUY. Went to pack for an upcoming trip and noticed brown stuff all over. I was storing the batteries in a separate case (which is now ruined). Thank goodness this wasn\\'t in any if my expensive scuba or camera equipment. Never had other brands do this. Always store batteries outside of equipment anyways. Totally bummed. Shame on you Amazon. Get out of the battery business. I buy A LOT on Amazon... ALOT, but no more batteries. The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kids can\\'t play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels. These batteries are junk. Some of the new once have no more power than the once they replaced. If they are good, they ware out very quickly. I don\\'t like to make negative reports, but these are so bad! They are bad batteries. Not long lasting at all absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free. I purchased these batteries because of the price and the backing of Amazon. I figured Amazon wouldn\\'t put their name on a poor product. I used 12 of these batteries in an application and all 12 failed within a few days. Other batteries lasted months. For now I\\'ll stay away from this product and fork out a few more bucks for a battery from a main stream manufacturer. These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won\\'t risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work. Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don\\'t last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn\\'t putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn\\'t replace quality. Won\\'t be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer. I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA\\'s. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon\\'s expected standards. I will give it a miss. This is the first Amazon product I\\'ve purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can\\'t be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe\\'s. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can\\'t say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long. WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT\\'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE. These batteries were expired dead when they arrived at my house. I was very disappointed. I\\'m a huge fan of amazon so I figured I\\'d give these a shot. These have no life whatsoever. Even something as low-power as tv remotes they only last about 2 weeks tops.Spend the extra money and go with name brand. You get what you pay for. They do not last very long at all. It\\'s better to buy Duracell. Maybe I received a defective batch but these are so bad.No longevity at all. Used up within 2 weeks whereas the branded ones last 2 months!I will not purchase them again regardless of the lower cost. I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn\\'t open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn\\'t unlock. I didn\\'t suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that\\'s all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren\\'t all created equal. WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I\\'m throwing these away and will never trust this brand again. Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn\\'t make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I\\'m talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children\\'s toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don\\'t buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined. Bought these March 2015. It\\'s now Feb 2017 and my son said his toy lightsaber had just stopped working. Opened it up and batteries have leaked causing corrosion to contacts. No longer works, even with new batteries. It\\'s not a very expensive toy, but the 1 most important aspect of a battery is that it not leak. What\\'s the point of saving a few dollars on batteries if they are going to ruin something much more expensiveWith major brands, you can send in leaked batteries and device for repair or refund. Although I\\'ve never done thisThe version I bought were silver and green, so perhaps they have changed.Leaked batteries had 1.46,1.46,1.25v respectively. I like these batteries, but a couple of times now after putting them in I have opened up the compartments to find battery acid leaking out inside, I figured it was just a one off, but it has now happened several times, I am reluctant to use them anymore in case I damage items I ordered these thinking they were rechargeable (I recognize the error on my part but that is not my complaint here) .. so when I received them and used them I was not surprised that they died VERY quickly. Upon attempting to recharge these I figured out they aren\\'t rechargeable (Once again big duh on my part)..Now I\\'m seriously surprised that I\\'m only getting a few hours of use out of them!! like a quarter of the use that a typical battery should offer. Horribly disappointed.. I will go back to the name brand batteries for sure. May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid\\'s toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far. Put together mobile but it refuses to turn. Kind of pointless. Next time would spend a few more dollars and get something more sturdy and reliable. I wanted solar batteries. They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn\\'t the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don\\'t work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas. 3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it\\'s to save time. This defeats that purpose. These batteries did not even last a day with some LED lights we used. I do not recommend these to anyone. Go with a good brand name. These batteries leaked into my mouse and killed it. Not cool Amazon. These worked for about a week. Then started leaking and just stopped working. I ended up throwing them away. I even had to throw a string of lights out because of the leaks of batteries. I will not purchase these again. They last about 1/2 the life of the Duracell ones. Not suitable for toys. Drained within just a couple of days. Not worth a crap don\\'t waist your money. I purchased these for under cabinet lighting and they hardly have enough power. The light is way more dim than other batteries. This batteries didn\\'t last very long in anything we used them in (clock, toy, flashlights). Would not buy them again. Overpriced, works about the same as raovac. Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries. a few in the lot didn\\'t work at all. All were dead almost most of the batteries drained out in 1 or 2 weeks with moderate use Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak Bad quality, many of the batteries were blank, not charged. Some only lasted for a week or so. Batteries are awful. Might get 1/4 the life other batteries Ive used. Will not be buying Amazon batteries again. Batteries did not last more than two days batteries didnt even last one month...very dissapointed Batteries must be old don\\'t work! batteries used primarily for remotes, batteries last for about 1 month BRUTAL! THEY DONT LAST LONG AT ALL! Dangerous Die way too fast Do not last near as long as other \\'off brand\\' batteries Does not last as long as the good batteries don\\'t last long. Replace batteries in my clock almost every 2 months. Half of the batteries received were dead and there is no replace option. Horrible batteries. So far every battery we have used hasn\\'t worked!!! I updated my credit car d more than six weeks ago. I won\\'t bother you in the future. I was missing a pack of 4 batteries when I opened the box today. Not impressed. I\\'m truly disappointed with these batteries Inconsistent. VERY short life. Junk wont charge Just what I needed - thank you LOVE THE BATTERIES.THANKS never again. don\\'t last. especially short life in cold weather. No good...worthless. I have no use for them. None of the batteries work Not universal. Did not work on garage door opener, given as gift but now cannot return. poor quality Returned for later purchase Run down very quickly! should buy duracell Terrible battery life!!!! That\\'s crap The package was open and missing two batteries. These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity. These batteries are awful, have no power and die fast these batteries do not last long and we have quite a few that are leaking.. these batteries do not perform as good as the cheapest ones on the market. These die way too fast. These suck. Had for a week. Stopped working. Garbage. theses batteries don\\'t last very long not worth the money they are terrible they do not last at all would love to get my money refunded. They paired these with a order that uses AA Total crap. Batteries last for minutes. Used these for 2 insta bulb lights purchased from here also and they last about a week. Crazy!!! Utterly worthless, no staying power. Wore out way to fast Worst battery I\\'ve ever used. Lasts 1/3 as long as eveready!!! Wrong Item Do not leave these batteries sitting on a dresser... or pretty much anywhere you don\\'t want battery acid leaked onto. We took the batteries out of our remote at night and woke up to our brand new 3500 dresser ruined. Awesome. Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time. I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don\\'t buy these. There were 2 batteries missing from the pack. Just annoying enough to write a bad review. Not annoying enough to do anything else about it... These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk Batteries seem to have very short life......... Multiple batteries leaked, ruining one toy and causing messes in other items. Poor quality. I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won\\'t last mare than a week in my TV remote. Pretty annoying! These last about 5 hrs in a roku remote using the headphones. Really disappointed in how long they last. Both packs were useless. Confirmed low charge with multimeter. These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same... Given its price, probably makes sense but doesn\\'t last very long even with lower power usage or lesser used devices. I\\'d spend few dollars more and buy Duracell pack from Costco. Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don\\'t last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved. Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. Out of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with. short battery life Lasted for barely any time at all. I have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but I can attest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the Amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands. I\\'m always willing to give Amazon products a try, but these batteries left a lot to be desired. Batteries last about a week in a wall clock- name brands last six months. Don\\'t waste your money. We have been extremely disappointed in these batteries. Put them in our game camera and they were dead after two weeks. Should have lasted two or three months. Same thing with everything we have used these batteries for. Don\\'t waste your money, Buy Duracell instead. I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it. Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one. I don\\'t know if I got a bad batch, but I\\'m getting less than two week\\'s of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I\\'m pretty appalled at how short these. I\\'m in San Francisco and it doesn\\'t get that cold so I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.I\\'ve tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won\\'t drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die. So, I now have an angry 2 year old. A broken new toy. And batteries that I cannot trust. I put new batteries in the toy and it stopped working a couple days later. I opened it up to find some batteries leaked also ruining the toy.Edit: Amazon has made since replaced the batteries for me. Update 4/30/16:I\\'ve been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn\\'t want to just throw them out but at this point is isn\\'t worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that\\'s usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won\\'t buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess. These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA\\'s a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt. Worst batteries I\\'ve ever bought. Last about two weeks in a remote control. We bought these batteries to use in a medical Holter Monitor. Typically we put batteries in for 24 or 48 hour monitors. After one use, we need to replace the batteries. These batteries did not even last the 24 hours. Patients wasted their time and the testing was wasted. It was embarrassing to make the patient reschedule their test due to our equipment failure. These cost our business money. Will never buy again. Most of these batteries either do not have any life left to them or they are die out after one use. terrible product. Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote. Can\\'t believe Amazon\\'s name is on these pieces of dung. Very short life. I\\'ve migrated to Eneloop rechargeables for AAA as well as AA now big savers, as I have a lot of doodads. I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn\\'t work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn\\'t work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I\\'m going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again. These DO NOT WORK. I have tried them in 2-3 different clocks, and they are not working at all. When replaced with other batteries, the clocks started to work fine again.You get what you pay for... Do not use these in any techy gadget, including remote controls, keyboards, and especially cameras! These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell AA in my small Christmas light strings and they last me 2.5-3 weeks with being constantly on. These have lasted about 4 days with the same use. I read other reviews which stated they were the same but it wasn\\'t until I put them in my normal light strings that I saw the difference. Will NOT order again. These batteries don\\'t work well! My bluetooth mouse wouldn\\'t stay on any more, even when I put fresh Amazon batteries in them. So I bought a new mouse and it wouldn\\'t work with the new batteries. Then I used Duracell and the mouse was fine!Same thing happened with my Roku remote. These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I\\'ve used! I should send back.. Very little capacity. They last only about 25 as long when compared with other main stream batteries They don\\'t seem to work except in very low energy items. Can\\'t get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality. They last a very short time once in use. Put fresh ones in a soap dispenser and they lasted 8 days. Other brand lasted 2 months Burnt up a copper string light I have been using for a years. Short life on other electronics compared to Duracell. Left in a wii controller for 2 months and leaked all over. Hardly last as long as a stick match. Total waste of money. DO not buy this product I\\'ve received this product to replace batteries in remote-control candles all three candles did not work I was ready to discard the candles when I decided to try different batteries. As soon as I put the different batteries from another company the candles worked fine. Tried to find a place to write to the seller but couldn\\'t so apparently I\\'m just stuck for the price of the batteries which are useless!!!!! Not sure why they won\\'t recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name. When I opened the package there were only 17 batteries, not the 20 that I ordered and paid dor. I often buy Amazon Basic products, and until I tried their batteries I\\'ve never had a complaint. But these batteries drain faster than any but the absolute cheapest I\\'ve ever used. So no bargain there. You get what you pay for with this, unlike most other Amazon branded items. Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I\\'ve had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that\\'s about it. Don\\'t last long at all. I\\'ve had better luck with cheaper batteries than I\\'ve had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did. These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can\\'t believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these. I used the batteries in my flameless candles 3x for about8 hours. Total bummer! They all died. Won\\'t purchase again!Amazon should reconsider selling these turkeys Wow. Was IDisappointed. How about a replacement for these fake batterieswith real ones! Awful. Have almost gone through a whole box to find a battery or two that actually work. I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. Pay a little more for quality batteries that work. Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. My experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product. did order or get I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my flameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. None of those worked either So I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don\\'t understand. I tried recharging them right out of the box and it says they are bad! I\\'ll by my rechargeables elsewhere WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell\\'s in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell\\'s they will same you money in the long run. Worst batteries ever. I use them in my remote and have to switch them every couple of weeks. Do not buy These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn\\'t return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME. Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn\\'t turn on the receiver. The AA\\'s I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA\\'s didn\\'t last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we\\'ll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries ! These batteries are the worst batteries I\\'ve ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I\\'ve since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I\\'ll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future. Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again. horrible --- they barely last a week in my tv remote control We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table. Since I purchased returned couple of times now is dead I have to return it again. My first problem didn\\'t paired. This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap. We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot. hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear It\\'s very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bose sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79 I spent more time trying get it functioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to BB. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didnâ€šÃ„Ã´t appreciate. Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn\\'t work. I finally got frustrated and returned it. Is Amazon kidding me They want me to pay 19.99 for an item that is a critical part of the functioning of their product Outrageous. I will find another 5V charger. I bought this thinking that I needed it but I didnt so it was a waste of money. I do so hate to waste money. the Kindle can hook to a regular cell phone charger and it comes with a cable that connects to the computer. For some reason I thought I just had to have this too when I bought my Kindle. One star because this should\\'ve been included when I purchased my Kindles. Bought this second one because I have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs. And if Amazon would concentrate on the loyal e-book readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle (I own one) I would be a happy camper. We need the option of adding memory (Amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and I\\'ll purchase). Just give us that option. Fires don\\'t work for just straight up reading (can\\'t read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen). Having to purchase these power adapters separately ticks me off. I don\\'t care about the cloud. I need books downloaded to my devices. We vacation often in our mountain house. Middle of nowhere (which I like). However, no wifi, no Internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless. I guess I read too much. Thousands of books. 5,000+ in my library at home before a stroke forced me to Kindle and now thousands more. Include adapters when purchasing devices and increase the storage capacity. No reason. This product is described as 5W, 1 amp. The Kindle line is mainly 5V (4.8V, what\\'s the difference) and around 1 amp, which is 5 Watts (5W). Why the mystery, guys Also, this deal is for US 110V market only I travel. I like that the previous simple FIRE charger was universal (i.e. 100V-240v). I like that the first Kindle charger was also universal. What are you people doing Or, is it that the copywriter in this case just doesn\\'t understandFor those who don\\'t understand the details of electricity, ANY device will tell you what it needs to feed. Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 volts to meet your device need. As far as AMPS (A). If your device says it needs 1.8 A. It\\'s perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that. Like 2 Amps. The device will only drink as much as it needs. A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charger just means the charger is taking a nap. Just avoid situations where your device needs more Amps than a charger can provide. It won\\'t necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended. My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working. Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won\\'t charge, won\\'t reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I\\'ve had with the Voyage, I\\'m not even comfortable with a \\'new\\' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can\\'t do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-( very good produ ct and service will defintely refer to a freind. I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make) If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything! The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn\\'t find it. I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we\\'re out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there\\'s some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there\\'s no \\'click\\' so you know it\\'s in place. It just slides in and out. We\\'ve had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can\\'t even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable. I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7\" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I\\'ve ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that\\'s if there\\'s only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you\\'re cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they\\'re being discontinued?) I\\'ll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet. This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle. I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It\\'s slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn\\'t made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer\\'s issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product. I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired I didon\\'t care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing. I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad. Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas. not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That\\'s where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees. Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them.

This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me. She uses it every day. She can\\'t get enough of it. horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case. I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it\\'s not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It\\'s totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn\\'t play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically! Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It\\'s going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey! Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too. Not able to play youtube that\\'s what my daughter likes. Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn\\'t even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I\\'d be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it\\'s a \"known issue\" and \"they\\'re working on it\". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they\\'re obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I\\'d look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it\\'s unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time! I cannot believe i bought this junk. It\\'s always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help. I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I . This product wouldn\\'t turn on nor charge and then store couldn\\'t locate another one for me. I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging. Didn\\'t want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to. This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs. did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn\\'t here and doesn\\'t know about this yet, she would have been crying. It takes forever to download apps. I\\'m returning it will be getting something else. I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. I bought this because I have ebooks in college.

I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50... The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn\\'t respond quickly and it very slow This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys\\' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don\\'t like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won\\'t use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig\\'s List for less than half of what I paid for it. I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it\\'s much easier. Aside from the fact that the saleman told me that the tablet would be able to get all the same apps that an Android tablet would be able to get from the playstore, which was hilariously wrong, this product would never connect to the internet correctly. I had to reset the internet every single time on the table for my son to use it, starting from day one and up. My son loved having the electric device and I didn\\'t take it back for those reasons, but now 60 days out, the thing doesn\\'t even charge anymore and I\\'m having to take it back in. At least I bought the warrenty, because this is literally a huge waste of money. I\\'d rather have spent $500 on a different tablet than this garbage. I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me. Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it... Slow response. Wait 5 sec to turn a page. Frustrating. Best Buy says too bad so sad for me. 7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won\\'t power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn\\'t work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn\\'t download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn\\'t matter now since it won\\'t even turn on or charge. Worked great but after awhile I wouldn\\'t unlock. After I\\'d enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don\\'t fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too. This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update I found this devices battery very poor and also didn\\'t like this device can\\'t support screen share capabilities with my Amazon Fire TV or Smart TV\\'s. Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good. I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these. The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever. My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon\\'s customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company\\'s operations, programming, or software. Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it. Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built.

Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else\\'s sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed. Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs. I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I . Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn\\'t get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item. I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn\\'t work for them because they are horrible. Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last.. Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself.... I don\\'t recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won\\'t charge or turn on. I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can\\'t open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can\\'t get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don\\'t know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don\\'t know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update Over the past few years, I have purchased Kindle Fires for various family members. The workmanship for those Kindles in abysmal. Two weeks ago, my Kindle Fire HDX shorted itself out. I replaced it with Amazon Fire 10.1. This device does NOT hold a charge for more than three and a half hours. You read that correctly!. I have been using it on a daily basis, each time it needs to be charged, it does a repeat performance. There is absolutely NO way that I will ever purchase any device manufactured by Amazon, ever again. I tell it like it is, if you want terrible device performance, opt for the Amazon product. If you need a reliable device, look at other manufacturers for the options you need. This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising Its very cool great picture good sound. Was kind of disappointed that i couldnt make calls but overall great piece of hardwark I donâ€šÃ„Ã´t care that you canâ€šÃ„Ã´t change the tablet to run like as you wish. Itâ€šÃ„Ã´s pre installed menu is not something you can change. This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising This is my 4th Kindle, and the worst so far. It randomly locks up and require a restart to do anything. I\\'ve probably had to do this a dozen times in the last week. It\\'s going back if they\\'ll take it. I\\'m sure its a great product but there was something wrong with the one I ordered on target.com. My daughter opened it on Christmas morning and was so excited. We went to charge it and it wouldn\\'t turn on. We tried holding the power button down for 40 seconds like the amazon website suggests, nothing, we left it charging for hours and still nothing. Very disappointed. This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying. This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying. The ads that pop up constantly make us almost unusable for kids. I thought this would be a great gift for a child until I got to the set up. The set up could not be completed unless a credit card number was entered. I refuse to put that type of information in the hands of a child so, I returned it. Itâ€šÃ„Ã´s great that you can enhance capacity via a memory card, but the fact that a brand new product stops working within an hour of opening it reduces confidence significantly Have owned IOS products as long as I can remember. Not on same level Bought this for my young son, because of the warranty. You are required to have a credit card stored in the account, and to turn on parental controls it blocks other features too like Alexa. This is the most ridiculous setup ever. I bought four fire tablets and each of them stopped charging immediately after the purchase. I wrote to Best Buy detailing the problem with the tablets and the fact I did not have insurance or the boxes to return the item. No response. Disappointed because I have made major and multiple purchases with this company. Won\\'t make any more purchases from Best Buy. Returned within a week, did not like it. I didn\\'t care for the ads every time I turned the tablet on. I donâ€šÃ„Ã´t care that you canâ€šÃ„Ã´t change the tablet to run like as you wish. Itâ€šÃ„Ã´s pre installed menu is not something you can change. The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow! I have had this product less than 6 months. It shut down unexpectedly and would not restart. I contacted Amazon and the only help they could give was to hold the power button for 40 seconds and when that did not work I was told to buy a new one. Quality of a product is measured in warranty and support. This product comes with very little warranty. It\\'s 2017 no reason this tablet cannot produce clear 1080 or higher resolution. I get it it\\'s cheap and for that it\\'s good but it just feels cheap and omg so manny pop up adds.. Comeon amazon Waste of money,You tube does not work on these tablets,so everything from there old tablet does not work on the new ones,so going back to the old ones and sending these back I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these. The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever. My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor This is not like other android tablets in a bad way. We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else\\'s sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed. Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs. Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work.

I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon\\'s customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company\\'s operations, programming, or software. Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.

This product is bad because it is locked into only Amazon services. I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn\\'t find it. The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we\\'re out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there\\'s some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there\\'s no \\'click\\' so you know it\\'s in place. It just slides in and out. We\\'ve had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can\\'t even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable. It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle. I didon\\'t care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing. Bought this for my daughter(3) and she can\\'t even use it because it is NOT kid friendly. It is so incredibly slow!! It freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. Also was supposed to come with a year free of Amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month !( it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. ) Keep calling Amazon and the foreign people can\\'t seem to figure out the problem. Don\\'t buy! So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case. I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it\\'s not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It\\'s totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn\\'t play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically! Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers. Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too. Not able to play youtube that\\'s what my daughter likes. This product wouldn\\'t turn on nor charge and then store couldn\\'t locate another one for me. This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs. did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn\\'t here and doesn\\'t know about this yet, she would have been crying. It takes forever to download apps. I\\'m returning it will be getting something else. The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn\\'t respond quickly and it very slow I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me. 7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won\\'t power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn\\'t work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn\\'t download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn\\'t matter now since it won\\'t even turn on or charge. Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It\\'s going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.

I didon\\'t care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing. Am used to Kindle Fire which I love. No light to read by in the dark. Hard to navigate. This was a gift - would never purchase on my own. After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That\\'s where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees. So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case. I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense.

Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers. Not able to play youtube that\\'s what my daughter likes. I cannot believe i bought this junk. It\\'s always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help. This product wouldn\\'t turn on nor charge and then store couldn\\'t locate another one for me. This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs. It takes forever to download apps. I\\'m returning it will be getting something else. The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn\\'t respond quickly and it very slow Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and \\'unknown boot\\' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I\\'m angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something. Stay away from the certified refurbished Amazon Fire TV. I received two Certified Refurbished defective fire TVs. The first the screen looked half corrupted, see the pictures. The second Certified Refurbished Amazon fire tv I received would not boot up, it was stuck in an infinite loop where I would only see the amazon logo for 10 seconds then it would boot up again.If anything, Amazon needs to re-visit its refurbishment process and quality control of the refurbished products they let get in consumer hands.Update 11/28/16: I purchased a new Fire TV during the BF sale and I have had no issues so far :). I was initially happy that my Kindle replacement charging cord arrived so promptly, it seemed to work fine. But after only one use, the outer covering of the cord started cracking falling off in bits. It now is almost completely covered by electrical tape, as the bits fall off w/ each every use. I will end up having to buy a new one after all... Can someone explain to me why I can find hundreds and hundreds of people with this disintegrating isulation on charging cord problem, but not ONE post from Amazon with an official Company Statement about these defective, inferior, slave-labor built, imported, crap charging cablesAnyoneI\\'ll be you dollars to donuts that these 100s of complains will bloom into 10s of thousands, as the existing, bad cables mature. (dry out, degrade, undergo radioactive decay, whatever their issue is). I\\'ll bet I\\'ll win! I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make) If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything! Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad. not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me. horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn\\'t even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I\\'d be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it\\'s a \"known issue\" and \"they\\'re working on it\". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they\\'re obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I\\'d look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it\\'s unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time! Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don\\'t buy this device. We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great. I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging. Didn\\'t want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to. i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50... This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys\\' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don\\'t like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won\\'t use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig\\'s List for less than half of what I paid for it. I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it\\'s much easier. Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it... was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store. Worked great but after awhile I wouldn\\'t unlock. After I\\'d enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don\\'t fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too.'"
